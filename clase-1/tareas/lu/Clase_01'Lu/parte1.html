    <p>Mummy Duck lived on a farm. In her nest, she had five little eggs
        and one big egg. One day, the five little eggs started to crack.
        Tap, tap, tap! Five pretty, yellow baby ducklings came out.</p>
    <p>Then the big egg started to crack. Bang, bang, bang! One big,
        ugly duckling came out. ‘That’s strange,’ thought Mummy Duck.</p>
