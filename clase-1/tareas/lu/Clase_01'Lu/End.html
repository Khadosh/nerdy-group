            <p>No one wanted to be his friend. It started to get cold. It started to snow! The ugly duckling
            found an empty barn and lived there. He was cold, sad and alone. </p>

            <p>Then spring came. The ugly duckling left the barn and went back to the pond. He was very
                thirsty and put his beak into the water. He saw a beautiful, white bird! ‘Wow!’ he said. ‘Who’s
                that?’</p>

                    <li>‘It’s you,’ said another beautiful, white bird.</li>
                    <li>‘Me? But I’m an ugly duckling.’</li>
                    <li>‘Not any more. You’re a beautiful swan, like me. Do you want to be my friend?’</li>
                    <li>‘Yes,’ he smiled.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>All the other animals watched as the two swans flew away, friends forever.</p>
