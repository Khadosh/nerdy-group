        The Tale of the Three Brothers was a fairy tale often told to wizarding
        children. Believed to be written by Beedle the Bard, it was published as
        part of a collection of his works called The Tales of Beedle the Bard
        .[1][2] While most wizards viewed this story as one that teaches
        children morals, such as humility and wisdom, others believed that the
        story refers to the <strong>Deathly Hallows</strong>, three highly
        powerful magical artefacts coveted by generations of wizards

      The three objects mentioned during the tale are believed by some to be the
      Deathly Hallows, the most powerful magical objects of their kind in
      existence. The <em>Elder Wand</em> is the unbeatable wand of the oldest
      brother, the <i>Resurrection Stone</i> is the stone given to the second
      brother that can bring back the dead, and the
      <i>Cloak of Invisibility</i> is the cloak given to the third brother that
      could hide the wearer even from Death.
